# LaggingDGPlacement
This Program describes the lagging Distributed generation unit placement in radial distribution system such as 33-bus and 69-bus distribution system.

Description :
   In this work, optimal DG unit placement is carried out and determine the suitable position and sizing on DG unit in distribution system. It is based on the concept of exhaustive search. It places DG at every bus in the system, and increase the DG size gradually and perform the load flow analysis, then check whether all constraints are satisified. then store the values. Still we know that these are time consuing process. For justification of the result with existing results we performed this one.

How to run and all other technical stuffs correponding to this work is mentioned in Instruction.doc
   
Have a look ove it.

Queries/Correction/suggestions are always welcome.
   
Thanks
